Agent Events are folders containing event definitions, schedules, and resources that agents can discover and execute automatically on a time-based or trigger-based schedule.

## Why Agent Events?

Agents are increasingly capable, but typically operate in request-response mode without the ability to schedule future actions or maintain long-running workflows. Agent Events solve this by giving agents a standardized way to define, discover, and execute time-based and event-driven workflows.

  <Card title="For event authors" icon="pencil">
    Build scheduled workflows once and deploy them across multiple agent products.

  <Card title="For compatible agents" icon="robot">
    Support for events lets end users give agents autonomous, scheduled capabilities out of the box.

## Adoption

Agent Events is a new open standard. We're actively seeking early adopters, contributors, and partners to help shape the future of event-driven AI agents.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Be an early adopter" icon="rocket">
    Integrate Agent Events into your agent platform and help define the standard.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Contribute" icon="code-pull-request">
    Help us improve the specification, documentation, and tooling.
  </Card>

## Open development

<Info>
The Agent Events format was originally conceived by [Krisi Hadjiev](mailto:krisihadjiev@gmail.com) and released as an open standard. We believe scheduled, event-driven workflows are essential for the next generation of AI agents.
</Info>

This is an early-stage project and we're open to:
- **Ideas** - Help us shape the specification
- **Contributors** - Improve docs, tooling, and examples
- **Adopters** - Integrate Agent Events into your platform
- **Partners** - Collaborate on the future of agentic automation
